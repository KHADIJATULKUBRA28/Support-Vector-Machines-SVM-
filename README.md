# SVM Classification – Breast Cancer Dataset

This project performs breast cancer classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM).  
The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of breast masses and labels tumors as **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)**.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling)
- Train–test split
- Linear SVM and RBF SVM models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualizations:
  - Decision boundaries
  - Confusion matrix heatmap
  - ROC Curve
  - Precision–Recall Curve

## Tools Used
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Results
The RBF SVM achieved the best performance with approximately **98% accuracy** after hyperparameter tuning.
